Player clicks start to progress to the name screen.
Player inputs a name & clicks submit.
Player is greeted by tama and is prompted to press another start button

once through the introductory screen the player will see the name, age, and 3progress bars. The user will also be presented with 3 buttons that correspond to the 3 progress bars: food, rest, entertainment.

If the user clicks the food button the food bar will fill.

If the user clicks the drowsiness/sleep button the screen colors will invert, the tama will sleep, and the rest bar will fill.

If the user clicks boredom/play a ball (or other toy) will pop onto the screen and the entertainment bar will fill.

^original thought process^


Here's what we actually ended up with:

(I used a little rpg dialogue for funsies on the starting screen.)
-The player submits a name in the text input box & presses "Let's go!"
-the main screen opens showing:
    -age in the upper lefthand corner
    -chosen name in the upper righthand corner
    -rapdily filling progress bars along the bottom of the screen
-the player can now press the 3 buttons below the corresponding progress bars to keep them at bay and watch as the ghost is fed, put to bed, or played with.
-over time the age will progress (5 ghost years per one minute) infinitly
-if the bars aren't kept below 100% the time/age counter will stop and an alert box will show up saying "game over"


I chose to go with a bright color pallette & stylized background/aesthetic to keep within the early 2000's nostalgia that tamagotchi's evoke.
